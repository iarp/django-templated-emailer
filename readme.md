========================
Django Templated Emailer
========================

Adds EmailTemplate and EmailQueue, to create and send templated emails.

I only work with Python 3.6 and 3.7 currently, as such these may not work in
previous versions. Most notably due to f-strings.

Installation
============

    pip install -e git+https://iarp@bitbucket.org/iarp/django-templated-emailer.git#egg=django_templated_emailer
